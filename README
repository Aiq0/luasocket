This is modified fork with support for
fd = server:acceptfd() -- as accept, but returns file descriptor
client = socket.tcp4(fd) -- now you can create client in thread from file descriptor
client = socket.tcp6(fd) -- same as above, but this is for IPv6, above is IPv4

so it is usable in threads as like in this example: https://gist.github.com/Deco/4026258
